# Architecture

A technical deep-dive into how iMessage Relay is wired together.

If you're trying to **use** the app, see [`README.md`](../README.md).
If you're trying to **test** it, see [`TESTING.md`](../TESTING.md).
If something's misbehaving, see [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

---

## 1. Top-level shape

iMessage Relay is a single binary, `ImsgRelay`, that runs in two
mutually exclusive **process modes**:

| Mode | Invocation | What's loaded |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Menu bar app** | `open "iMessage Relay.app"` (default) | `NSApplicationMain` → `AppDelegate` → menu bar UI, Hummingbird REST API, HTTP MCP transport, Cloudflare Tunnel supervisor, outbound HTTP relay |
| **Stdio MCP server** | `ImsgRelay --mcp` | Bypasses AppKit entirely. Boots `ImsgClient` and a single `MCPService` on `StdioTransport`. No GUI, no menu bar, no event relay, no Hummingbird. |

This split lives in [`src/Sources/main.swift`](../src/Sources/main.swift):
the `--mcp` branch runs synchronously on a `DispatchSemaphore` so stdio
stays line-oriented, while the default branch hands off to
`NSApplicationMain`.

The two modes are intentional: AppKit subtly steals `stdin`/`stdout`
in ways the MCP SDK doesn't like, so Claude Desktop spawning the binary
with `--mcp` always gets a clean stdio surface.

## 3. Concurrency model

Swift 6 strict concurrency throughout — `swiftSettings:
[.enableUpcomingFeature("StrictConcurrency")]` in `Package.swift`.

| Isolation | Owners |
|-----------|--------|
| `@MainActor` | `AppDelegate`, `MCPService`, `TunnelStatus`, all SwiftUI |
| `actor` | `ImsgClient`, `HTTPRelay`, `StatelessHTTPServerTransport` (from SDK), `StdioTransport` (from SDK) |
| `final class @unchecked Sendable` | `LocalAPIServer` (HBR captures it across the detached server task; we audit by convention), `RelayQueue` (internal `DispatchQueue` for SQLite serialization) |
| `final class` (no isolation, `nonisolated(unsafe)` weak refs) | `TunnelManager` (process supervisor — touched from a child reader task and from the main UI), commented `nonisolated(unsafe)` for the surface that's read concurrently |
| `nonisolated` static helpers | All argument-extraction helpers in `MCPService` — `intArg`, `stringArg`, `utf8`, etc. — so the SDK's tool handler closure (which runs outside the main actor) can call them without an actor hop |
| `Sendable` | `EventEnvelope`, `AppConfig`, all transferred values |

The pattern is: **I/O surfaces are actors, UI is `@MainActor`, the
connecting glue is `@MainActor` (`AppDelegate`) and explicit `Task`s
shuttle data between them.**

## 4. Boot sequence

```

        ├── HTTPRelay(queue:, tunnel:)
        ├── ImsgClient(queue:, relay:) — opens chat.db read-only via IMsgCore

        ├── mcpTask = Task { try await mcp.run() } # SDK Server bound to HTTP transport
        ├── api.start()                            # Hummingbird detached task
        ├── relay.relay(type: .relayStarted, ...)  # boot beacon
        │
        └── if config.tunnelEnabled { startTunnel() }
```

The FDA probe is **before** any IMsgCore construction. A previous
revision let IMsgCore throw `authorization denied` and bubbled it up as
a fatal alert — replaced because it was hostile UX. Now the friendly
prompt is the only failure path users see.

## 5. Inbound message flow (chat.db → your endpoint)

```

   │

         │
         ├── URLSession POST to config.serverEndpoint

         │

                          (parks immediately as 'dead')
```

### Cursor priming policy

The cursor is the watcher's "high-water mark" — only messages with
`ROWID > cursor` get streamed. The policy depends on the user-visible
`AppConfig.backfillOnRestart` flag (Settings → Inbound stream →
"Backfill missed messages on restart"; default off):

| `backfillOnRestart` | Behavior at every launch |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `false` (default)   | `ImsgClient.primeCursor()` always re-reads `MAX(ROWID)` from `chat.db` and overwrites the stored cursor. The watcher starts from "now"; anything received while the app was offline is **skipped**. |
| `true`              | If a cursor is already stored, leave it alone — the watcher resumes from the last delivered `ROWID`, replaying messages received during the offline window. If no cursor exists (true first launch), prime to `MAX(ROWID)` the same way. |

In either mode, the cursor is updated on every delivered message in
`handle(message:)`, so toggling the flag at runtime takes effect on
the next restart without losing state.

`primeCursor()` opens `chat.db` read-only with `SQLite.swift` and runs
`SELECT MAX(ROWID) FROM message`. If the query fails (FDA race, no
Messages history, …) we fall back to whatever cursor exists — worst
case is a full backfill on a true first launch, never a crash.

---

### Attachment serving

`LocalAPIServer` exposes `GET /attachments/:message_id/:index` for the
URLs that go out on inbound events. The handler:

1. Calls `ImsgClient.attachmentBytes(messageID:, index:)`
2. That calls `MessageStore.attachments(for:, options: AttachmentQueryOptions(convertUnsupported: true))`,
   indexes into the result, and reads bytes from `convertedPath ?? originalPath`
3. Defensive: the resolved absolute path must live under
   `~/Library/Messages/Attachments/` (`NSString.standardizingPath`
   prefix check). Anything outside → `nil` → 404, never expose existence
4. Hummingbird `Response` returns 200 OK with `Content-Type` from
   `served_mime_type ?? mime_type` and a sanitized
   `Content-Disposition: inline; filename="..."` header

Bearer auth applies — same middleware as the rest of the API.

For very large attachments (videos) the current implementation loads
the file into memory before responding. The 1 MB body limit on the
POST routes doesn't apply (this is a GET serving a `byteBuffer`-backed
response). Streaming the file via Hummingbird's response body API is
a future optimization.

---

## 6. Outbound flow (REST / MCP → Messages.app)

```
Client (curl / Claude Desktop / remote agent)
   │
   │ POST /send  or  MCP tools/call imsg_send_message
   ▼
LocalAPIServer or MCPService
   │
   ▼
ImsgClient.send(to:, text:, chatID:, service:)
   │
   ▼
IMsgCore.MessageSender — drives Messages.app via AppleScript
   │
   ▼
   Messages.app delivers iMessage (or SMS via service: "sms")
```

The first call triggers the macOS Automation → Messages permission
prompt. After grant, sends complete in ~100-500ms.

---

## 7. MCP — two transports, one tool catalog

`MCPService` is transport-agnostic:

```swift
init(imsg: ImsgClient, transport: any Transport) {
    self.imsg = imsg
    self.transport = transport
    self.server = Server(name: "imsg-relay", version: ..., capabilities: ...)
}
func run() async throws {
    await registerTools()
    try await server.start(transport: transport)
    await server.waitUntilCompleted()
}
```

The seven tools are registered once via
`server.withMethodHandler(CallTool.self) { params in ... }` and the
dispatch switch keys on `params.name`.

### Stdio mode (`--mcp`)

```
main.swift --mcp
   ↓
MCPService(imsg:, transport: StdioTransport())
   ↓
SDK reads from stdin, writes to stdout, line-delimited JSON-RPC
```

Lifetime is the process. A semaphore in `main.swift` holds the runloop
until the Task completes.

### HTTP mode (menu bar)

```
AppDelegate.bootRuntime
   ↓
   ├── mcpTransport = StatelessHTTPServerTransport(validationPipeline: ...)
   ├── mcp = MCPService(imsg:, transport: mcpTransport)
   ├── api = LocalAPIServer(... mcpTransport: mcpTransport)
   ├── mcpTask = Task { try await mcp.run() }   # SDK Server bound
   └── api.start()                              # Hummingbird routes alive
```

When a request hits `POST /mcp`:

```
Hummingbird Request
   │
   ▼  LocalAPIServer.makeMCPRequest(req:, body:)
MCP.HTTPRequest { method, headers, body, path }
   │
   ▼
mcpTransport.handleRequest(_:)              [StatelessHTTPServerTransport]
   │
   ├── runs validation pipeline (Accept header, Content-Type, MCP-Protocol-Version)
   ├── classifies JSON-RPC message kind (request / notification / response)
   │
   ├── notification → yield to SDK Server stream → return 202 Accepted
   │
   └── request →
         │
         ├── yield body to SDK Server's message stream
         ├── stash CheckedContinuation keyed by JSON-RPC id
         │
         ▼  (SDK Server picks up the message, dispatches the registered handler)
         ▼
         ▼  Server calls transport.send(responseData)
         ▼
         ├── matches responseData's id against pending continuations
         └── resumes the awaiting handleRequest call with the response bytes
   │
   ▼
MCP.HTTPResponse (.data, .accepted, .error, etc.)
   │
   ▼  LocalAPIServer.makeHummingbirdResponse(from:)
Hummingbird Response
```

### Why stateless, not stateful

The SDK ships both `StatelessHTTPServerTransport` and
`StatefulHTTPServerTransport`. We picked the stateless one because:

1. **No SSE stream needed** — our tools are all request/response. No
   server-initiated push, no subscriptions.
2. **No `MCP-Session-Id` complexity** — simpler client integration
   (e.g. shell scripts with `curl`).
3. **Bearer auth handles identity** — we don't need MCP sessions
   for access control.

When/if we add resources or prompts that benefit from streaming, the
stateful variant slots in by swapping the transport. Tools don't change.

### Why `OriginValidator.disabled`

The SDK's default pipeline includes `OriginValidator.localhost()`, which
matches only `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` Host headers. That blocks all
tunnel traffic. We replace it with `OriginValidator.disabled` and rely
on the bearer-auth middleware (`BearerAuthMiddleware` in
`LocalAPIServer.swift`) for access control.

---

## 8. Cloudflare Tunnel supervision

`TunnelManager` is a process supervisor for `cloudflared`. It runs in
one of two modes — selected by `AppConfig.tunnelMode` — and the
process invocation, stderr parsing, and "tunnel ready" detection all
branch on that mode:

| | `.quick` (free) | `.named` (custom domain) |
|---|---|---|
| **`cloudflared` arguments** | `tunnel --no-autoupdate --url http://localhost:<port>` | `tunnel run --no-autoupdate --token <token>` |
| **Ingress config source** | The CLI's `--url` arg | The Cloudflare dashboard ("Public Hostnames" attached to the tunnel) |
| **Public URL discovery** | Regex `https://[a-z0-9-]+\.trycloudflare\.com` against stderr | Watch stderr for `Registered tunnel connection`; URL is `https://<config.tunnelHostname>` |
| **CF account needed** | No | Yes |
| **URL stability** | New random URL every restart | Stable, user-owned hostname |

The lookup order for the `cloudflared` binary itself is the same in
both modes:

```
1. App bundle: Contents/Resources/cloudflared        (CI release builds)
2. /opt/homebrew/bin/cloudflared                     (Apple Silicon brew)
3. /usr/local/bin/cloudflared                        (Intel brew)
4. /usr/bin/cloudflared                              (system-wide install)
5. `which cloudflared` fallback                      (anything else on PATH)
```

If none of those resolve, the user gets an alert with `brew install cloudflared` instructions and a "Copy install command" button.

#### Mode dispatch: `buildRuntime(port:)`

Internally, `start(port:completion:)` calls `buildRuntime(port:)`
which reads the current `AppConfigStore` value and returns a
`Runtime` struct:

```swift
private struct Runtime: Sendable {
    let arguments: [String]
    let urlExtractor: @Sendable (String) -> String?
}
```

The common process-management code (stdout/stderr pipes, lifecycle
events, `Resolver` callback box, `TunnelStatus` mirroring) doesn't
care which mode is active — it just calls `runtime.urlExtractor(text)`
on each stderr chunk until it returns a non-nil URL, then publishes
that URL exactly once.

For `.named`, `Runtime.urlExtractor` ignores the actual text content
of stderr (cloudflared in token mode doesn't print the public URL
because it isn't its job to know it — the hostname is bound at the CF
side) and only checks whether `Registered tunnel connection` appears.
That's the signal that one of the four edge connections is healthy
and traffic can start flowing. We then surface `https://<hostname>`
where `hostname` is `config.tunnelHostname` after `normalizeHostname()`
strips an optional `https://`/`http://` prefix and trailing slashes.

#### Misconfiguration guard

If the user selects named mode but leaves the token or hostname
empty, `buildRuntime` returns `nil` and presents a warning alert with
an "Open Settings" button. The alert posts `Notification.Name.imsgOpenSettings`
which `AppDelegate` listens for and uses to call its
`openSettings(_:)` action — keeps `TunnelManager` from needing a
direct reference to `AppDelegate`.

#### Restart on config change

`AppDelegate.configChanged` (the observer on
`AppConfigStore.didChangeNotification`) keeps a
`TunnelConfigSnapshot` of `(enabled, mode, token, hostname, port)`
from the last time it applied changes. On every Save it diffs the
new snapshot against the previous one and only stops + restarts the
tunnel when one of those five fields actually changed. Unrelated
saves (bearer token rotation, backfill toggle, etc.) leave the
running tunnel alone.

#### Observability

`TunnelStatus.shared` is the `@MainActor ObservableObject` that the
SwiftUI Settings view subscribes to. `TunnelManager` posts updates
via `Task { @MainActor in TunnelStatus.shared.publicURL = url }` at
three lifecycle points: URL/connection detected, process started,
process exited.

The tunnel URL is also written into every outbound event's
`server.callback_url` so remote endpoints learn the current address.
In free mode this matters every restart (URL rotated); in named mode
the URL is constant but the event always carries the truth.

---

## 9. Settings UI

`SettingsView` is plain SwiftUI on a grouped form style:

```swift
TabView {
    generalForm     // identity, endpoint, bearer, reactions
        .tabItem { Label("General", systemImage: "gear") }
    networkForm     // ports, tunnel toggle, retry config
        .tabItem { Label("Network", systemImage: "network") }
    statusForm      // tunnel URL, queue stats, about
        .tabItem { Label("Status", systemImage: "info.circle") }
}
.padding(20)
.frame(width: 620, height: 540)
```

State lives in `@State private var config: AppConfig = AppConfigStore.shared.current`.
`save()` writes back via `AppConfigStore.shared.update { $0 = config }`,
which notifies `AppConfigStore.didChangeNotification`. `AppDelegate`
observes that notification to restart tunnel / refresh menu / etc.

The save bar uses `@State private var justSaved = false` with a 1.8s
`DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` reset and an `.opacity.combined(with:
.scale)` transition for the "✓ Saved" indicator.

---

## 10. Permissions

| Permission | Probe | Trigger |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Full Disk Access** | `Permissions.hasFullDiskAccess()` — opens `chat.db` via `FileHandle(forReadingFrom:)`, swallows error to a bool | First launch + every boot |
| **Automation → Messages** | Implicit — surfaces when AppleScript `tell application "Messages"` first runs | First outbound send |
| **Contacts** *(optional)* | Implicit when Contacts framework first queried | First handle resolution |

The FDA flow is the only one we own UX for. The other two ride the
default macOS prompts.

`Permissions.openFullDiskAccessSettings()` uses the deep-link URL
`x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_AllFiles`
which jumps directly to the right pane in System Settings.

---

## 11. Logging

`os.Logger` categories live in `Log.swift`:

```swift
enum Log {
    static let app    = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "app")
    static let api    = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "api")
    static let queue  = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "queue")
    static let relay  = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "relay")
    static let imsg   = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "imsg")
    static let mcp    = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "mcp")
    static let tunnel = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "tunnel")
}
```

`subsystem = "com.imsg-relay.app"`. Watch them live:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.imsg-relay.app"' --info
```

---

## 12. Build pipeline

```
swift build --configuration release
   │
   ▼
create-app-bundle.sh
   │
   ├── mkdir iMessage Relay.app/Contents/{MacOS,Resources,Frameworks}
   ├── cp ImsgRelay → Contents/MacOS/
   ├── cp Info.plist + entitlements
   ├── cp Resources/* (icons, etc.)
   ├── cp Sparkle framework (or stub if not present)
   ├── codesign --deep --options runtime --sign "Developer ID Application: ..."
   └── codesign --verify
```

`Package.swift` declares:

```swift
.executableTarget(
    name: "ImsgRelay",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "IMsgCore", package: "imsg"),
        .product(name: "Hummingbird", package: "hummingbird"),
        .product(name: "MCP", package: "swift-sdk"),
        .product(name: "SQLite", package: "SQLite.swift"),
        .product(name: "Sparkle", package: "Sparkle"),
    ],
    swiftSettings: [.enableUpcomingFeature("StrictConcurrency")]
)
```

CI lives in `.github/workflows/release.yml` — matrix build (arm64 +
x86_64), code-sign with `APPLE_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`,
notarize via `notarytool`, package DMG via `create-dmg`, ship to GitHub
Releases on tag push.

---

## 13. Why these specific dependencies

| Dependency | Why |
|------------|-----|
| `openclaw/imsg` (IMsgCore) | The hard parts — chat.db reads, watcher debouncing, AppleScript send wrapper. Direct SwiftPM library, not subprocess, so we get native types and no IPC overhead. |
| `Hummingbird` | Lightweight async server, Swift 6 friendly, no ObjC, minimal deps. Picked over Vapor for size and concurrency-model fit. |
| `modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk` | Official MCP SDK. Ships both stdio and HTTP server transports as of v0.12.x. |
| `SQLite.swift` | Type-safe SQLite, used for both the retry queue and (read-only) the chat.db cursor priming query. |
| `Sparkle` | The standard for macOS auto-updates. ED25519 signature verification. |
| `cloudflared` *(external binary)* | The tunnel. Embedded in `Contents/Resources/cloudflared` in release builds; falls back to brew path in dev. |

---

## 14. Out of scope (intentionally)

The PRD calls iMessage Relay a "dumb edge node". These do **not** live
in this codebase:

- Business logic
- AI / agent orchestration
- CRM integration
- Conversation state machines
- Analytics
- Multi-tenancy
- Workflow builders
- Long-term message storage beyond the queue

Those belong on the **remote server** that consumes our events and uses
our APIs. The relay is a translator, not a brain.
